grequests
~~~~~~~~~

This module contains an asynchronous replica of ``requests.api``, powered
by gevent. All API methods return a ``Request`` instance (as opposed to
``Response``). A list of requests can be sent with ``map()``.

This is the updated version for request > 1.0 compatability:
https://github.com/reclosedev/grequests/commit/6566cb4760c112cf6d2c17bd88e15ff8235dc390
